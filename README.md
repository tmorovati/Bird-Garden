## Overview
This project is aimed at analyzing zebra finch audio data, preprocessing the data, and developing a machine learning model to detect and categorize the different calls of zebra finches. The main steps involved in this project are:

1. **Data Collection:** The audio data for zebra finches is collected and stored in a database.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Random samples of audio data are selected and concatenated to create artificial data. This data is then labeled with the help of available labeling systems.

3. **Machine Learning Model:** A machine learning algorithm is implemented to detect syllables in zebra finch calls and classify them into relevant categories.

## Prerequisites
----------------
## Installation
---------------

## Usage
* Data Preprocessing:

Run the Jupyter Notebook data_preprocessing.ipynb to create artificial data and apply labels to the zebra finch calls.
* Machine Learning Model:

Run the Jupyter Notebook zebra_finch_classification.ipynb to train and evaluate the machine learning model for call detection and * categorization.

* Additional Notes:

Add any additional notes or instructions specific to your project.
